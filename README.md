Friendly AIRbot which will help you manage and make decisions about your finances

# Introduction
By cloning this code you are hereby implied to contribute on the development of this project. Some of us, and sometimes most of us,
are not very proficient when it comes to manage our own finances. Also, most of the time it's because of lack
of enough information. This project wants to use dynamic and machine-learned structures and decision flows in order to take
us to a new level making decisions regarding the management of the money we earn, posses or even owe.

PLEASE, FEEL FREE TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT BY MAKING IT BETTER!
